The problem can be described as: 

Calculate the yield to maturity rate Y of a bond. 
Given: 
  The current price P > 0,
  Coupon payments C > 0 and C < P,
  The face value of the bond FV > 0, FV > C and FV > P,
  The number of payments n, which is a non-negative integer. 

After some simplifications, the problem can be reduced to the combination of the following two equations: 
(1) b = (1 + 1/a)^(-n)
(2) (FV/C - a) * (1 - b) = (FV-P) / C
Where a = 1/Y and b = 1 / ((1+Y)^n). 

On the a-b axis, the problem can be viewed as a root-finding problem for a monotonic and convex function:
